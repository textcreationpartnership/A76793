            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> ſent you yeſterday a note wherein I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted you in generall that Sr. <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> had newly routed the Kings Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, under the command of Generall <hi>Goring.</hi> Having now another oppertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ſending and more time for wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, I ſhall give a more large, yet a brief relation too of the particulars.</p>
            <p>On Munday laſt we marcht from <hi>Crookhorne</hi> towards <hi>Ilcheſter,</hi> a gariſon of the Kings, ſtanding upon the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, (on the other ſide of which <hi>Gorings</hi> Army was drawne up) they having broken downe all the Bridges upon the river from <hi>Evill</hi> to <hi>Bridgewater,</hi> and made good the paſſes by parties of theirs: we faced <hi>Ilcheſter</hi> with our Horſe about noone, and ſent a ſmall party towards the Towne to beate in their horſe-guard, whereby we might the better view their workes, for we thought to have forced over the paſſe, Wee beate their guards in, having wounded ſome of them, and taken a Lieut. priſoner, but found it difficult to paſſe that way: whereupon we marched with our foote to <hi>Evill,</hi> 3 miles thence that night, and found that Bridge
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113092:3"/>alſo broke up. But the next morning earely inteli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence came the enemy was marched towards <hi>Glaſſeabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> and <hi>Briſtoll.</hi> Whereupon we thought to have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them, but our intelligence being not certaine of the way of their march, becauſe a party of them had marched another way, and finding their garriſon. viz. <hi>Ilcheſter</hi> quitted and burnt (the ſtrongeſt part of it,) we marched thither and quartered there on Teuſday night till better intelligence.</p>
            <p>The next morning we underſtood they were march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Langport,</hi> (another Garriſon upon the river) from whence they ſent a party of horſe towards <hi>Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſter</hi> where Major Generall <hi>Maſsies</hi> forces were quartered but being beaten backe and purſued neare <hi>Langport, Maſsie</hi> found 3 Regiments of the enemies horſe turned out to grtſe, which they ſeized upon and kept: and in the purſuite tooke divers cullours from the enemy, and endangered <hi>Gorings</hi> perſon very much, whileſt Sr. <hi>Tho. Fairfax</hi> with his Army was on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide the river within 3 miles of <hi>Langport,</hi> at a place called <hi>Sutton</hi> viewing the purſuit, having received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence that night of this defeate given to the enemy by <hi>Maſsy,</hi> the next morning the enemy were all drawne out of <hi>Langport,</hi> on that ſide of the river where Our quarters were, wee marched forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with towards them: with 7 Regiments of horſe (which were all the horſe on this ſide the river) and one Company of Dragoons, and 8 Regiments of foote, And drew up againſt them in a Campania within a mile of Langport upon one hill, they being upon another, and there was betwixt us a ſmal valley, and only a road way to paſſe through, the ſides of the valley being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed grounds by hedges and a ſmall brooke running
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113092:3"/>in the bottome betweene us. Here we had ſome skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miging with our horſe, till at laſt the enemy finding it would be much to their diſ-advantage to loſe, or to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer us to march up that way, they endeauoured to make it good by lining the hedges with Muſquettiers, but we reſolved about 10. of tht clocke in the morning to force our way (although they had alſo placed a peeces of Ordinance on the top of the hill in the roade way) when they perceived what we intended by our draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards them, they ſent Dragoones to make good the paſſe, and as we thought, intended to draw off their Muſquettiers, but before they could draw them off, we had engaged them by forlorne hopes of Muſquettiers, drawn downe to the hedges, both on the right hand and left of that paſſe, which they with ſtood a while ſtoutly; but having drawne up our great Guns, and given them about 50. or 60. great ſhot, their horſe began to retreat, and their foote could not abide ſo much heat, as they found in our Muſquettiers, of both forlorne hopes; whereupon our horſe began to advance up the way: then their foote ran from the hedges. The Regiments late Lieut. Gener2l is own Regiment (for it is now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into two) being in the Van, advanced up the hill, and Major Bethell of one of thoſe Regiments gave the horſe ſuch a gallant charge up the hill, that they after a long diſpute with him quitted the ground, and gave li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for the reſt of our Horſe to come up; who found them not reſolved for a long diſpute, and therefore charging them deſparately the enemy all faced about, and ran away both horſe and foote moſt ſhamefully: The foot moſt of them into <hi>Langport</hi> which was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in halfe a mile of them, but for haſt threw downe all their armes by the way, and the Horſe, all that were
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:113092:4"/>on this ſide the River, towards <hi>Bridgewater,</hi> our Horſe purſuing with the Lieutenant Generall <hi>Cromwell,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they came within a mile of <hi>Bridgewater,</hi> killing many by the way, and taking many priſoners, while they were purſuing the Lieut. Generall gave order for a party of Horſe to face <hi>Langport,</hi> their Garriſon to ſecure the reare, And after his returne finding them marching out of <hi>Langport,</hi> on the other ſide of the water, made ready a party of Horſe and Dragoons, if it were poſſible to come at them to purſue them alſo: when they were all marched out of the Towne, but ſome of their owne that they killed, who would not march with them: they ſet the farther end of the Towne on fire in a narrow ſtree<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, thinking thereby to have hindred us that we could not come after them: But although the fire burnt very violently on both ſides, ſo that many durſt not venture, the Lieut. Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall himſelfe advanced in the head of 6. Troupes of Horſe, with about 3. of Dragoons to purſue them, (two Regiments of Foot being commanded to march as faſt as they could after: he overtook them within 2. or 3. miles of the Towne: And although their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was farre greater, yet it pleaſed the Lord to ſtrike them with ſuch a feare, that 15. Troupes of Horſe, and about 2000. Foote, the greateſt part of then ran away and hid themſelves, but we tooke hundreds of them priſoners, and marched through their owne flame with them back againe into <hi>Langport,</hi> ſhewing them their wickedneſſe. Thus God hath bleſſed us exceedingly, we have taken many priſoners, I cannot at preſent know what they are, but we have taken the Lieutenant Generall of their Ordnance, and adjuvant Generall, 3. Colonels, with Lieutenant Colonels and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:113092:4"/>Majors, and many Captaines and other Offices, about 30. Foote Colours, I have not yet learnt how many Horſe Colours, 2. peeces of Ordnance, the reſt with their Trayne being ſent to <hi>Bridgewater,</hi> in the morning two waggons of Ammunition, about a 1000. Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets, I know not how many Horſes, above a 1000. priſoners of Foote. All their armes which we tooke not, they threw into the River, and corne ficlds, kill'd about 60. or 80. of them, with the loſſe of about 4. or 5. men at moſt: Many of the priſoners have taken up armes, the reſt are ſent as I thinke for <hi>London,</hi> wee are now upon our purſuit with the Army, within 2. miles of <hi>Bridgewater,</hi> both Horſe, Foote, and Trayne, intending to fall to worke there next, here are 3000. club-men declared for us, and keepe the paſſages with muſquets between <hi>Bridgewater</hi> and <hi>Briſtoll.</hi> Sir, wee doe, doe you alſo bleſſe God, who hath raiſed up a poore company of men to do him ſuch ſervice, Men who were by ſome thought not firt to be tollerated in the Kingdome, but faithfull to God and thoſe who have employed them, without any other ends then Gods glory, and the publique welfare of this poore Kingdome.
